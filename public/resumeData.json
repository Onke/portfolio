I discovered my love for programming at university and have been dedicated to building a career in this field ever since. My background is in Python and Java, and I am always eager to learn more. I am a proactive and creative problem-solver with a strong work ethic and a track record of successfully managing multiple projects at a time. In my free time, I enjoy staying active with activities such as going to the gym and listening to podcasts. I am also an avid reader and enjoy learning about businesses, playing games, and trying out new recipes in the kitchen.",
